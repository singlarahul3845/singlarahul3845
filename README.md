# 👋 Hi, I’m Rahul Singla

## About Me
I'm an AI Automation Executive at SlideTech Systems. I started my journey as an SEO Intern, manually publishing blogs — until curiosity led me to automate my own tasks using Python and AI tools.  
With no coding background at first, I learned by breaking down workflows, using tools like ChatGPT, and building real-time automation solutions that saved hours of manual work.

Today, I build tools that automate content workflows, extract and analyze data, and support decision-making for SEO and content teams. I’m also diving deeper into data analytics and backend development.

## Interests
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, AI-powered tools, SEO analytics, and smart dashboard development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Power BI, and Tableau — along with backend integration for scalable automation.

## Projects I've Built
- ✅ Scrapers, blog automation tools, metadata generators, and content analyzers using Python
- ✅ Keyword Engine Dashboard with 4 modules: Keyword Trend, URL Trend, Compare Month, and Tension Analysis
- ✅ Email automation system hosted on AWS, running on a 30-minute cycle
- ✅ GUI tools for internal teams to simplify daily workflows

## Collaboration
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python-based automation, SEO analytics dashboards, and tools that make teams more efficient.  
I'm also open to contributing to AI/data-driven open-source projects.

## More About Me
I believe that automation isn't just for coders — it's for problem solvers.  
I enjoy experimenting with AI tools, creating custom scripts for real use cases, and continuously learning how to turn data and workflows into powerful automation systems.
